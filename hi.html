                <h2>Facts about Dogs</h2>
                <p>Dogs have been bred for desired behaviors, sensory capabilities,
                     and physical attributes. Dog breeds vary widely in shape, size, and color.
                      They have the same number of bones (with the exception of the tail), powerful 
                      jaws that house around 42 teeth, and well-developed senses of smell, hearing,
                       and sight. Compared to humans, dogs have an inferior visual acuity, a superior sense of smell,
                        and a relatively large olfactory cortex. They perform many roles for humans, 
                        such as hunting, herding, pulling loads, protection, companionship, therapy,
                         aiding disabled people, and assisting police and the military.</p>

                <p> Communication in dogs includes eye gaze, facial expression, vocalization,
                     body posture (including movements of bodies and limbs),
                      and gustatory communication (scents, pheromones, and taste). 
                      They mark their territories by urinating on them,
                       which is more likely when entering a new environment. Over the millennia,
                        dogs became uniquely adapted to human behavior; 
                        this adaptation includes being able to understand and communicate with humans.
                         As such, the humanâ€“canine bond has been a topic of frequent study, and dogs' 
                         influence on human society has given them the sobriquet of "man's best friend".</p>
